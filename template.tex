\section{Project Objective}

\section{Scientific or Technological Baseline Planned To Be Advanced}
\subsection{What was/were the pre-existing solution(s), and how did the company investigate the pre-existing solution(s)?}


\subsection{What is the baseline that the advance is being measured against?}

\subsection{What was the limitation of the existing technology/science baseline at the start of the R\&D project?}

\section{Scientific or Technological Advancement Sought}
\subsection{What is the advance achieved (or sought to be achieved) by the company at the end of the R\&D activity?}

\section{Scientific or Technological Uncertainties Encountered}
\subsection{What was it about the state of science or technology that made it uncertain it could not be made to do what the company wanted it to do?}

\subsection{When was the technological uncertainty identified?}

\subsection{Is the issue a matter of feasibility, or, is the issue a matter of practical application, or is it both?}

\section{How were the Scientific or Technological Uncertainties Overcome}
\subsection{What would be the typical methods that would be applied to resolving this particular scientific/technological uncertainty by a competent professional in the field and why were these not applicable to overcome the uncertainty?}

\subsection{When were the uncertainties resolved, or, if not resolved what is the measure the company is planning on using to identify when it will be considered resolved?}
